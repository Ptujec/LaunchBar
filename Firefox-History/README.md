This is a simple action that displays your browser history for Firefox. You can use it by simply selecting Firefox in LaunchBar and pressing `space`. As always, you can type to narrow down results to what you are looking for. 

**Note**: LaunchBar has Firefox history built-in. URLs will open in your default browser, though. I hope LB will add an option to choose where URLs should open in the future (system default or the browser to which the history item belongs).
