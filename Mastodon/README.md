# LaunchBar Action: Mastodon Search 

<img src="01.jpg" width="587"/> 

Press `␣` (space) to search Mastodon accounts and hashtags. `↩` will open your the website of your home instance.

If you hit return `↩` on a selected account it will open the account on the Mastodon instance you entered on the first run (assuming that is where you are signed in). Use `⌘↩` to open the account page on it's own home instance. Or `⌥↩` to copy the userhandle to your clipboard.

You can change your preferred Mastodon instance with `⇧↩`.

Hashtags work fine, too. But their benefit is somewhat limited, because of the way Mastodon works.
