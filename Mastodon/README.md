# LaunchBar Action: Mastodon Search 

<img src="01.jpg" width="587"/> 

Search Mastodon accounts and hashtags easily with LaunchBar. 

On first run you will have to choose your Mastodon instance. You can change your preferred Mastodon instance any time with `⇧↩`.

**1) Accounts**

If you hit return `↩` on a selected account it will open the account on the Mastodon instance you entered on the first run (assuming that is where you are signed in). Use `⌘↩` to open the account page on it's own home instance. Or `⌥↩` to copy the userhandle to your clipboard.


**2) Hashtags**

Hashtags open per default on your home instance. Use `⌘↩` to view results on mastodon.social (which usually has a lot more).
