There is this new app by Sindre Sorhus called [Supercharge](https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge). I am always curious about apps in that category. Supercharge has an option to create a text file right in the current Finder location. I thought LaunchBar probably has that built-in. I does. But it works a little differently. **So I thought I'd build my own. Here is how it works:**

**1) It will create a text document in the location of the top Finder window.** If there is none, it will use the desktop. The first thing it will ask for is a name. You also need to add the extension. Any plaintext-based extension will do.

**2) It'll then select the new document in LaunchBar, so you can work with it there**, like opening it in a text editor of your choice. Or you could delete it right away (`command` + `delete`), because you just wanted to test if it's really working ðŸ˜‰.

BTW: Did you know you can add a new line of text to any .txt or .md file directly in LaunchBar by pressing `shift` and `space`? 

That's it. Time will show how much I'll really use it. But I think it's pretty cool and shows how neat a feature like that is within LaunchBar.
