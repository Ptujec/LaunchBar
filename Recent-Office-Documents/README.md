# LaunchBar Actions: Recent Office Documents

Do you miss recent files when you select Word, Powerpoint or Excel in LaunchBar and press space?

These actions should at least come close to [what you are used from apps like Pages, Keynote, etc.](https://youtu.be/lLZgKIthbOk?t=82). The actions are associated with the corresponding office apps, so now Word, Powerpoint and Excel will show documents you recently worked on when you press space.  

## Limitations 

Documents will not show up in this list if you just open them without making changes. Unfortunately Microsoft only updates the date in its apps plist when a document gets changed. 

**Note**: After tweeting about my actions I found out that [@nriley](https://github.com/nriley) already built [actions for the very same purpose](https://github.com/nriley/LBOfficeMRU/releases). They don't have some of the limitations but rely on Python.
