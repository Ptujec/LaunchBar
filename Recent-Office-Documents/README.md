# LaunchBar Actions: Recent Office Documents

Do you miss recent files when you select Word, Powerpoint or Excel in LaunchBar and press space?

These actions should at least come close to [what you are used from apps like Pages, Keynote, etc.](https://youtu.be/lLZgKIthbOk?t=82). The actions are associated with the corresponding office apps, so now Word, Powerpoint and Excel will show documents you recently worked on when you press space.  
Unfortunately Microsoft only updates the date in its apps plist when a document gets changed.
