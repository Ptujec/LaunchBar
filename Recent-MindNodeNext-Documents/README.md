# LaunchBar Actions: Recent MindNode Next Documents

Do you miss seeing recent files when you select [MindNode Next](https://mindnode.com/next) in LaunchBar and press `space`?

This action should at least come close to [what you are used to from apps like Pages, Keynote, etc.](https://youtu.be/lLZgKIthbOk?t=82). If you select MindNode Next and press `space`, it will show your recent documents. 

With another `space` you can even use quicklook to preview the selected document. 

## Limitations 

As MindNode Next documents are not stored as files but in a database, there are some things you cannot do, e.g. renaming a selected document or revealing it in the Finder.
