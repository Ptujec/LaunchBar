# LaunchBar Actions: Recent MindNode Next Documents

Do you miss seeing recent files when you select MindNode Next in LaunchBar and press `space`?

This action should at *least* come close to [what you are used to from apps like Pages, Keynote, etc.](https://youtu.be/lLZgKIthbOk?t=82). If you select MindNode Next and press `space`, it will show documents you recently worked on. 

With another `space` you can even use quicklook to preview the selected document. 

## Limitations 

Currently, this action can only sort files by last modified date, not last viewed date.
