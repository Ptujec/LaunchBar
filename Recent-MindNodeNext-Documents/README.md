# LaunchBar Actions: Recent MindNode Next Documents

Do you miss seeing recent files when you select [MindNode Next](https://mindnode.com/next) in LaunchBar and press `space`?

This action should at least come close to [what you are used to from apps like Pages, Keynote, etc.](https://youtu.be/lLZgKIthbOk?t=82). If you select MindNode Next and press `space`, it will show your recent documents. 

With another `space` you can even use quicklook to preview the selected document. 

## Extras

You can paste a link to a selected document by holding `shift`, or in Markdown format including the title by holding `option` while pressing `return`.  
You can even create a `.mindnodealias` by holding `control`. The alias will be created in the directory of the current Finder window (with a fallback to the desktop).

## Limitations 

As MindNode Next documents are not stored as files but in a database, there are some things you cannot do, e.g. renaming a selected document or revealing it in the Finder.
