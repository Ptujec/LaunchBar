# LaunchBar Action: Spotifeed

This is build upon [Tim Dorrs excellent service](https://github.com/timdorr/spotifeed). 

Simply search for the Spotify show you would like to  get the feed for on the web. You can send the URL to the action or just run it to pick up the URL from Safari.

Now you have the feed on your clipboard and can use [Apples universal clipboard feature](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460) to paste it in a proper podcast app like e.g. [Castro](https://castro.fm) on your phone.
