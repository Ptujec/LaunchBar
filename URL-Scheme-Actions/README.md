# LaunchBar URL Scheme Actions

The following actions are great for what David Sparks calls [contextual computing](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/12/linking-and-contextual-computing/).

## Mindnode (iA Writer)

(iA Writer works the same way)

## Mail

<img src="mailURL.gif" width="600"/> 

This action might be a little overkill in terms of options, but its basic function is very simple. Just run the action to paste the URL of an open or selected email into the current text field.

Hold `shift` for Markdown or `command` for Rich Text Format. By default, this will use the email subject as the title. If you hit `space` before running the action, you can even enter a custom title.

## List

- Paste iA Writer URL Scheme (Markdown and RTF options)
- Paste Mail URL Scheme (Markdown and RTF options)
- Paste Mindnode URL Scheme (Markdown and RTF options)
