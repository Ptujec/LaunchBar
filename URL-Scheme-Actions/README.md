# LaunchBar URL Scheme Actions

The following actions are great for what David Sparks calls [contextual computing](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/12/linking-and-contextual-computing/).

## Mindnode (iA Writer)

(iA Writer works the same way)

## Mail

<img src="mailURL.gif" width="600"/> 

This action creates a formatted link to an open or selected email. A rich text and Markdown version is saved and inserted by the system depending on the target. You can add a custom title by pressing `space`. Paste only the URL using `command` + `enter`.

**Note:** The action includes a Swift script that should be compiled for best performance. You can use my [Compile Swift Action](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Compile-Swift-Action) for that.

## List
