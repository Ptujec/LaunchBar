[â†’ Go to my website to view a curated list of my actions.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)

## Installation
[Click here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download this repository. This includes the entire content including screenshots. But it's not a large download.

You can also [clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). It's the same as downloading it, but the GitHub way. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) makes this fairly easy. This is also a good way to follow changes. 

After downloading or cloning and unzipping just double click the `.lbaction` packages you want to use to install them.  

## Updates

Stay uptodate with my [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates) action.

Most of my actions also integrate with Action Updates by [@prenagha](https://github.com/prenagha). You can find the [latest version in his Github repository](https://github.com/prenagha/launchbar). For more information and a signed version of Action Updates [visit his website](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/).
