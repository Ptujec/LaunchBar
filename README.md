## Installation
[Click here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download this repository. This includes the entire content including screenshots. But it's not a large download.

After downloading or cloning and unzipping just double click the `.lbaction` packages you want to use to install them.  

## Updates

Stay uptodate with my [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates) action.

Most of my actions also integrate with Action Updates by [@prenagha](https://github.com/prenagha). You can find the [latest version in his Github repository](https://github.com/prenagha/launchbar).
