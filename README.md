[â†’ Go to my website to view a curated list of my actions.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)

## Installation

[Click here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download this repository. This includes the entire content, including screenshots, but it's still not a large download.

**After downloading and unzipping, just double-click the `.lbaction` packages you want to use to install them.**  

BTW: You can also [clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository). It's the same as downloading it, but the GitHub way. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) makes this fairly easy. 


## Updates

Use [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates) to keep track of new versions of all my actions and discover new ones at the same time. 

Most of my actions also support [Action Updates](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/) by Padraic Renaghan.
