## Installation & Updates

[Click here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download (or in Git terms, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)) this repository. It's not large.

After downloading and unzipping, just double-click the `.lbaction` packages you want to use to install them.

**Or simply use [LaunchBar Repo Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/LB-Repo-Updates#launchbar-repo-updates-action)! It helps automate both updating existing and installing new actions.**

Most of my actions also support [Action Updates](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/) by Padraic Renaghan.
