[→ Go to my website to view a curated list of my actions.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)

## Installation

[Click here](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download (or in Git terms, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)) this repository. It's not large.

After downloading and unzipping, just double-click the `.lbaction` packages you want to use to install them.

Or just install the two actions mentioned below, and the rest should be a breeze.

## Updates

My [LaunchBar Repo Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/LB-Repo-Updates) action in combination with [Local Action Updates](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates#launchbar-action-local-action-updates) is the **easiest way to stay up to date** on all my actions and discover new ones at the same time.

Most of my actions also support [Action Updates](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/) by Padraic Renaghan.
