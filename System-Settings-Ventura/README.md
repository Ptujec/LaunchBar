# LaunchBar Action: System Settings Ventura

This action is just filling the gap until [Objective Development](https://www.obdev.at/index.html) releases their Ventura update. 

It has what is available in `‌/System/Library/ExtensionKit/Extensions/`. It's using localized names if possible. But `‌CFBundleDisplayName` is missing in some of the `‌InfoPlist.loctable` files. Unfortunately the section icons can't displayed either. They are generated automatically from SF Symbols. No support for that in LaunchBar yet. (Not sure there is even an API for that.)
