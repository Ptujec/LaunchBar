# Launchbar
These applescripts are for use with [Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/)
- Install applescripts by moving them to a folder which is indexed by Launchbar. The default would be ~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions
- Install actions is much easier. Just double click them.
- For most of them you can enter a query if you hit spacebar when the script or action is selected in LaunchBar
- Some applescripts may work even without LaunchBar or might only need some minor modification
