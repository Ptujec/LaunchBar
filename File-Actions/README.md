## List 
- Sort folder content by extension
- Filter folder content by type (images, movies, presentations, audio, documents) Note: Choosing good categories for all kind of file types is hard to impossible to do. So this action has just a few. It is mainly based on UTI type declarations provided in plists by the system and installed apps. It's not perfect and requires some manual sorting. But it performs very well. I first tried to loop through the files in a folder and get info via the command line for each file. But that made it very slow.
