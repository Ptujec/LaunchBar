# LaunchBar Action: Gedankensalat (Scratchpad)

The use-case of this is for when you working on something and a random thought comes to your mind. As a LaunchBar user hitting `⌘ ␣` (command-space), `␣` (space) and type away should be the quickest way to capture a random thought. This is what this action is for.
