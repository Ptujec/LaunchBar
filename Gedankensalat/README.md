# LaunchBar Action: Gedankensalat (Scratchpad)

The use case for this is when you are working on something, and a random thought comes to your mind. As a LaunchBar user, hitting `command` + `space` and typing away should be the quickest way to capture a random thought. This is what this action is for.

Just select the action, press `space` again, and write down what's on your mind, then keep doing what you are doing.

Later, you can go back and decide what to do with it.

You can easily remove items with `command` + `return`, or you can pass them on to an app or another action.

## Settings

The items are stored in a simple text file. You can choose a file or create a new file with `option` + `return`.
