# LaunchBar Action: Gedankensalat (Scratchpad)

The use case for this is when you are working on something, and a random thought comes to your mind. As a LaunchBar user, hitting <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> and typing away should be the quickest way to capture a random thought. This is what this action is for.

Just select the action, press <kbd>space</kbd> again, and write down what's on your mind, then keep doing what you are doing.

Later, you can go back and decide what to do with it. Hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to view your list of entries.

You can easily remove items with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>, or you can pass them on to an app or another action. 

BTW, <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd> will open the text file in your default editor.

## Settings

The items are stored in a simple text file. You can choose a file or create a new file with <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>.
