# LaunchBar Action: Join Meeting

This action checks your recent events for links to Zoom or Microsoft Teams, events that started within the last hour or will start in the next 20 minutes.

Press `‚èé` to join the selected meeting. 

## Note
You can improve performance by making the `default.swift` file an executable with `swiftc -O default.swift`. You obviously need to change the `LBScriptName` key in `info.plist`, pointing it to the executable. 
(Unfortunately I can't share the action with the executable at the moment, because I can not sign the action. So the action would be actually unusable.)
