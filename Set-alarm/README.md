# LaunchBar Action: Set alarm

<img src="01.jpg" width="644"/> 

This action makes use of the new built-in clock app. It lets you set alarms in no time. It relies on a shortcut, so it needs a tiny bit of setup.

You can also add a description. (Just follow the pattern of time - space - description, e.g., "16 Tea"). Hold `CMD` to open the clock app to check if everything worked as expected.

## Set up

1) Install the shortcut named ["Set alarm"](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2c26f5f6e8ad4bcea0215ebf3b1c9b10)

2) Download and install the action as usual below.
