<img src="01.jpg" width="644"/> 

This action makes use of the new built-in clock app. It let's you set alarms in no time. It relies on a shortcut so it needs a tiny bit of set up.

You can also add a description. (Just follow the pattern of time-space-description e.g. "16 Tea")

## Set up

1) Install the shortcut named ["Set alarm"](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fdb0869ec1f04bab9390ba988d6e2eab)

2) Download and install the action as usual below.
