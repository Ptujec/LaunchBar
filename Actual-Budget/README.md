# LaunchBar Action: Actual Budget

*[→ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)*

[Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) alternative to YNAB. I don't love that the macOS client is an Electron app. But it is pretty good, and well maintained.

This action displays account balances and the most recent transactions.

A special feature is that the action detects links to Mail in a transaction note and opens the linked Mail if you hit `enter`.

If you have multiple budgets, you can show them with `command` + `→`.
