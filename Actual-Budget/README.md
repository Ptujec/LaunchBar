# LaunchBar Action: Actual Budget

*[â†’ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)*

[Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) alternative to YNAB. I don't love that the macOS client is an Electron app, but the project is pretty well maintained and does what I need.

The following actions are trying to improve the experience a little.

## Actual Budget (Accounts, Transactions, and Categories)

This action displays account balances and the most recent transactions.

You can show category balances and budgets with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>. Depending on your database size, it may take a little, because right now it needs all transaction and budget data to calculate balances correctly.

If you have multiple budgets, you can select them with <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>.

**Note:** This action is using [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) to indicate and split transactions and mail links in the `label` item. Those will not show correctly if SF Symbols is not installed. 

## Add Transaction

This action lets you add transactions. Start by pressing `space` to enter the amount.

**Note:** While the other action only reads data, this action writes directly to the database, which could lead to issues. Before doing so, it will close the app and always create a backup, which can be restored using the desktop app if needed. In addition, the action currently deletes the cache of the desktop app after creating a new transaction to ensure proper display of budgets. This will slow down the performance of the desktop app a little.
