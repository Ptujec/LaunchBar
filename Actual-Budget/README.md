# LaunchBar Action: Actual Budget

*[â†’ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)*

[Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/) is a free and [open-source](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual) alternative to YNAB. I don't love that the macOS client is an Electron app. But the project is pretty well maintained and does what I need.

This action displays account balances and the most recent transactions.

You can show category balances and budgets with `command` + `enter`. Depending on your database size, it may take a little, because right now it needs all transaction and budget data to calculate balances correctly.

If you have multiple budgets, you can select them with `option` + `enter`.
