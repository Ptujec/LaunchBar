# LaunchBar Action: Every Process 

This action lists current running processes sorted by CPU usage percentage. The action is especially helpful to see, if a process is going crazy. You can test that with a site like [CPU Stress Test](https://cpux.net/cpu-stress-test-online).

You can press return `↩` to kill a selected process. Press `⌥↩` to reveal the executable of the selected process in `Finder`. 

**Note:** It is totally normal that both `WindowServer` and `LaunchBar` are fairly high, because it is a snapshot of what you where just doing. You get a more realistic picture if you delay the terminal command the action is built upon (with `⇧↩`).
