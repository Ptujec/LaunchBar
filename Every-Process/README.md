# LaunchBar Action: Every Process 

This action lists current running processes sorted by CPU usage percentage. You can easily filter for a specific process by typing (as usual with LaunchBar). The action is also helpful to see if a process is going crazy. You can test that with a site like [CPU Stress Test](https://cpux.net/cpu-stress-test-online).

You can press return `↩` to kill a selected process. Press `⌥↩` to reveal the executable of the selected process in `Finder`. 

**Note:** It is totally normal that both `WindowServer` and `LaunchBar` are fairly high, it reflects what you where just doing. You get a more "realistic" picture if you delay the terminal command the action is built upon (with `⇧↩`). It still is **only a snapshot** and CPU usage changes constantly. So please use Activity Monitor for a more accurate picture over time. 
You can also use arrow keys `←` `→` to "refresh" the action fairly quickly.
