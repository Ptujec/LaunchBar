# LaunchBar Search Actions

*[→ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)* 

## Apps

- Twitter Search
- ~~Zotero Search~~ ([Moved to it's own folder](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Zotero-Actions#readme))
- Notion Search
- iA Writer Search (with an excerpt of the content found in subtitle)
- Mindnode Search (with excerpt)

## Websites

- DuckDuckGo (with "Feeling ducky")
- Kagi Search
- Wikipedia (EN, DE)
- MuseScore Sheetmusic
- Ultimate-Guitar.Com
- Google Search (with DuckDuckGos version of Feeling Lucky)

The added benefit of these actions over a custom search template are the suggestions. There are built in versions of Google and DuckDuckGo, but without some of the features.
