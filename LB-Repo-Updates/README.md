# LaunchBar Action: LaunchBar Repo Updates

*[â†’ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)*

I'm still testing this action but it should be pretty save. 

The idea of the action is to check local repos for updates, pull them, and run my [Local Action Updates action](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Local-Action-Updates). 

This should make keeping up with updates for actions that are shared in GitHub repos a little easier.
