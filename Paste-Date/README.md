# LaunchBar Action: Paste Date

*[→ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)* 

This is a simple action that lets you paste the date in an active text field. If you hit `enter`, the date will be the **current date**. 

But you can **modify** the date when you hit `space` instead. One way you can modify the date is to **enter a number** to get the current date plus the number of days. This can also be a negative number.

Another way to modify the date is to **specify a day** by its name. You will be presented with a few common options as well as some more advanced ones.

**Note:** You don't need to write out the full name for weekdays. In the example in the screenshot, "f" is enough to paste the date for the upcoming Friday.

## Format settings

In settings (`shift` + `enter`), you can set a default (primary) and an alternative format style for your dates.

You can choose from different local date format styles (short, medium, long, and full) as well as ISO 8601 (yyyy-MM-dd). 

When you use the action, you can access the alternative format with `option` + `enter`. Or you can choose from all the available styles with `command` + `enter`.

**Note:** Local date format styles are defined by the system. As of macOS Ventura, the only style you can modify seems to be "short" (`System Settings → Language & Region → Date format`). 
You can try [tweaking the others in the Terminal](https://www.caseyliss.com/2022/11/14/ventura-date-formats).
