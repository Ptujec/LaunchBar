# LaunchBar Action: Ask ChatGPT

*[‚Üí Click here to view a list of all my actions.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)* 


This action allows you to send requests to ChatGPT. There are **two main ways to use it**:

### 1: Chat away

Press `space` to start or continue a "conversation" with ChatGPT. Type your question or command, and then select one of the options presented to you, such as starting a new chat or continuing the current conversation.

### 2: Use predefined prompts 

Press `enter` to access a menu of predefined prompts. You can customize them in the [settings](#settings) to suit your needs. This is convenient for frequently used tasks.

### What‚Äôs next?

No need to wait while the answer is generated. All this is happening in the background without affecting the LaunchBar interface.

The chat will open as a simple **markdown file** when done.

Additionally the answer is automatically copied to the **clipboard**.

This action works very well with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) in preview mode. [Marked](https://marked2app.com/) is also a great option since it is specifically designed to preview markdown files.

### Additional Features

- To view recent chats, select the action in LaunchBar and press `command` + `enter` \
(BTW: You quick look or delete chats in this view or any of [the usual stuff](https://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/WorkingWithFiles.html#append-text) you can do with files in LaunchBar.)
- Use alternative personas with `command` + `enter` when you are done entering text. 

### Settings

Access the settings with `option` + `enter`. Here you can:

- Choose a default persona
- Choose between `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` models
- Choose an editor to display the resulting chats 
- Set or reset your API key
- Update, reset or customize prompts and personas

You can customize and add as many prompts and personas as you want, and choose an emoji as the icon to identify them easily. 

```
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "icon": "‚úçüèª",
      "argument": "The instruction passed to the model",
      "title": "Your unique title",
      "addURL": false,
      "addClipboard": true,
      "description": "A description to display as the subtitle",
      "persona": "The persona for this task (optional)"
    }
  ],
  "personas": [
    {
      "title": "Assistant",
      "icon": "weasel",
      "description": "This is the default persona",
      "persona": "You are a helpful assistant."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Miscellaneous

- [ChipiChat](https://github.com/quinncomendant/ChipiChat.lbaction#chipichat-launchbarchatgpt) is a cool alternative LaunchBar action for ChatGPT. 
- Here is a [long list of interesting prompts](https://prompts.chat) that may serve as inspiration for both prompts and personas to use with this action.
- [QLMarkdown](https://github.com/sbarex/QLMarkdown) is a great Quick Look plugin for Markdown files.
- I really enjoyed [this episode of Changelog](https://changelog.fm/534#t=45:20) and especially [Simon's](https://github.com/simonw) take on LLMs.
