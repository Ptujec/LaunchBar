# LaunchBar Browser Actions
These actions require [Accordance Bible Software](https://www.accordancebible.com/). There is also a post related to these in the [Accordance Forums](https://forums.accordancebible.com/topic/5191-launchbar-scripts/). 

In order to make display and paste actions work properly it is suggested to set up citation settings like this in Accordcance: 

<img src="prefs.png" width="600"/>

## Display in large type 
<img src="accdisplay.gif" width="600"/>

## Paste scripture
<img src="accpaste.gif" width="600"/>



## List
- Display in large type
- Paste scripture (with an option (⌘⏎) to paste as Markdown blockquote)
- Look up scripture 
- Search words *(I built in a script that can translate input that Accordance does not understand. In this version it is disabled. You will need to enable it in default.js and adjust sloTitles.applescript. (As is the AppleScript will translate from Slovene to English book titles.))*
