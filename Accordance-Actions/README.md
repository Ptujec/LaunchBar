# LaunchBar Browser Actions
These actions require [Accordance Bible Software](https://www.accordancebible.com/). There is also a post related to these in the [Accordance Forums](https://forums.accordancebible.com/topic/5191-launchbar-scripts/). The original AppleScripts/Automator Workflows were developed by [Joe Weaks](http://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/search/label/accordance).

In order to make display and paste actions work properly it is suggested to set up citation settings like this in Accordcance:

## Display in large type

## Paste scripture

Options: `⇧⏎` = Settings, `⌘⏎` (after entry) = Choose translation

## Look up scripture

Options: `⌘⏎` (after entry) = Choose translation

## Search words

Per default spaces are replaced with "AND" tags. Alternatively you can use quotation marks to search for an exact term, or you can fine-tune your search by using "A" (AND), "O" (OR) or "N" (NOT) as shown here:

**Advanced**: With "#" you can scroll to a specific book. For example "Moses#Acts_6:14" will return all verses with "Moses", but scroll to Acts 6:14. 
You can also choose a specific translation from a list if you press `⌘⏎` after entering your query.
