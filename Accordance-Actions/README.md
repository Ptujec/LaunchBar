# LaunchBar Browser Actions
These actions require [Accordance Bible Software](https://www.accordancebible.com/). There is also a post related to these in the [Accordance Forums](https://forums.accordancebible.com/topic/5191-launchbar-scripts/). 

In order to make display and paste actions work properly it is suggested to set up citation settings like this in Accordcance:

You also can use "A" (AND), "O" (OR) or "N" (NOT) manually as shown here:
