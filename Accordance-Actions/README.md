# LaunchBar Browser Actions
These actions require [Accordance Bible Software](https://www.accordancebible.com/). There is also a post related to these in the [Accordance Forums](https://forums.accordancebible.com/topic/5191-launchbar-scripts/). The original AppleScripts/Automator Workflows were developed by [Joe Weaks](http://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/search/label/accordance).

In order to make display and paste actions work properly it is suggested to set up citation settings like this in Accordcance:

Options: ⌘⏎ (after entry) = Choose translation

## Search words
Per default spaces are replaced with "AND" tags or with "OR" tags when holding option. By holding command the string will stay as entered.

You also can use "A" (AND), "O" (OR) or "N" (NOT) manually as shown here:

With # you can scroll to a specific book. For example "Moses#Acts_6:14" will search for all instances of Moses, but scroll to Acts 6:14. You can also specify a translation followed by : e.g "ESVS:Moses#Acts_6:14". There are suggestions so you can avoid misspelling.
