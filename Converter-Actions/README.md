The purpose of this action is to convert currencies you use frequently with as little input as necessary. 

You can use `.` or `,` as decimal separators. Group separators are not supported currently. You can show a detailed view or do the usual things with a selected result (e.g. paste with `Shift (⇧)` + `Enter (↩)`).
