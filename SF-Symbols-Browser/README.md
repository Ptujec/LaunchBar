# LaunchBar Action: SF-Symbols Browser 

If you know what SF-Symbols are you probably have the [app installed](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) along with the [fonts](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).

This action enables you to browse through them without opening the app. If you have the app installed you can simply select it and press space  <kbd>␣</kbd>.

You can then either paste the symbol <kbd>↩</kbd> or the name <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>↩</kbd> .
