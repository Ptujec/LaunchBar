Open current URL in different Browser. Supported browsers: 
- Safari
- Brave
- Arc
- Firefox (**Note**: FF can be buggy because it has not sufficient AppleScript support!)
- Chrome

You can also close the site in the browser you came from with `⌘↩` (cmd-return). Set default behavior in settings `⇧↩` (shift-return). **Note**: Firefox can not close individual tabs, just windows!
