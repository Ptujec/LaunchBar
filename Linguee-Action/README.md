… or paste the selected word with `Shift` `Enter`. Pasting works for both suggestions and results. 

## Note

Linguee may block your IP address for 24 hours if you use this a lot. You should, however, still be able to see the preview items.

Website changes may break this action at any time. 

Also, there are two more language actions in this repository (not counting the Slovene ones), **[DeepL](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/DeepL-Action#readme)** and **[Verbs](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Verbs-Action#readme)**.
