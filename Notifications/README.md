*Note: The following actions work for German and English user interfaces only. I developed them on macOS 12 Montery, but Big Sur should work also.*

## Action: Notification Actions

Let's you run actions of the most recent notification (group). 
 
## Action: Show/Dismiss Notifications

This will dismiss all notifications unless there is a group of notifications. If there is a group of notifications, it will show them along with a few other options. 

## Action: Dismiss All Notifications

Dismiss all notifications, no matter if they are grouped or not.

## Action: Open Notification

Opens the most recent notification.
