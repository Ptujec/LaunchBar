# LaunchBar Action: Link to Website

*[â†’ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)*

This action pastes the title and URL of the current website, formatted as **rich text** or **markdown**, depending on the text field you are using. 

By default, the action takes the website information from your default browser. If your default browser is not running, it will look for one of the other supported browsers (Safari, Chrome, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi). 

You can enter a **custom title** by holding down the space bar. If you hold down the command key, only the **plain link** will be inserted.

## Setup (IMPORTANT!)

**In order to run smoothly, actions written in Swift need to be both "un-quarantined" and compiled. I made [a dedicated action that does both](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Compile-Swift-Action#readme). Run the `.lbaction` bundle of this action through the compile action before you start using it.**
