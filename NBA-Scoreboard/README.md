## Features

- Per default the action displays games from yesterday and today.
- Enter days from now (e.g. "-3" or "2") or an upcoming weekday ("Sunday", "sun") to look up games from the past or games scheduled in the near future.
- The icon displayed in LaunchBar is either the one from the winning team or the home team, if the game has not started yet.
- Dates and times for scheduled games are translated to your timezone.
- You can press enter `‌↩` to go to the summary of a selected game on espn.com. *(This uses DuckDuckGo and might not always be reliable)*
- Hit `‌⌥ + ↩` to check Youtube for a game recap of the selected game when completed. If the game is not yet completed `⌥ + ↩` should lead you to NBA.com (e.g. to watch the game via league pass). *(This uses DuckDuckGo and might not always be reliable)*

## API Key required

This action requires an API key. There is a free tier that should work fine for this action.

Go to https://new.balldontlie.io to create your account and get your key.

You will be prompted to set the API key automatically. You can also manually reset the API key with `‌⌥ + ↩` any time.
