# LaunchBar Plain Applescripts

These AppleScripts are created for use with [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/). Install by moving them to a folder which is indexed by LaunchBar. The default location would be ~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions

**Some of them may not work any more**. Usually it's better to embed scripts in actions. I may update some of them in the future. Let me know if you are interested in a particular one.
