# LaunchBar Actions

## Installation and usage
These applescripts are created for use with [LaunchBar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/)

Install AppleScripts by moving them to a folder which is indexed by LaunchBar. The default location would be ~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions

Some of them probably are outdated.
