# LaunchBar Action: Search Notes

**Note:** I just realized that [Roey already made an Action for Notes](https://github.com/roeybiran/launchbar-actions/tree/main/notes-search.lbaction/Contents). It is really good. I think it outperforms mine. 

A simple action to search Apple Notes and open them in the app.

The action is associated with the Notes app. So you can simply select Notes and press `space` to search.  

Note: AppleScript is  a little slow for my taste. But I have not found a better solution. Shortcuts was about the same in my testing.
