# LaunchBar Action: SRT Timestamp (for QuickTime)

This action takes the current position of the current video in QuickTime Player and pastes it as a timestamp that is compatible with the [SRT subtitle format](https://docs.fileformat.com/video/srt/) (e.g. `00:00:10,176`). 

If you use `⌥↩` the separator arrow `-->` will be added as you paste the timestamp. 

## Tipps

[Subtitles Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pepri.subtitles-editor) for VS Code is a nice visual help while creating the subtitles. It also has some other handy features like e.g. renumbering. 

In [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/qtpa4808515d/mac) you can move by frame with `←` and `→`. 

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) lets you burn in the subtitles and should be fine for most cases. I needed some styling so I ended up using [Subtitle Burner](https://apps.apple.com/app/subtitle-burner/id1023093745?mt=12) instead. It's not the prettiest but does the job.

Also, if you know a good dedicated native app for the Mac for creating and burning subtitles let me know.
