The action is associated with [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), so you can simply select Drafts and press `space` to show your notes. Narrow down the results by typing as usual.


## Search Drafts

This action lets you search for content in your drafts. It'll prioritize results with a hit in the title. The subtitle shows the date it was last accessed and a snippet of the context of the hit.
