## Download

Unfortunately this directory is to big for [DownGit](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/DownGit). 
You need to [download the whole repository](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for this one.

## Updates

This action integrates with Action Updates by @prenagha. You can find the [latest version in his Github repository](https://github.com/prenagha/launchbar). For more information and a signed version of Action Updates [visit his website](https://renaghan.com/launchbar/action-updates/).
