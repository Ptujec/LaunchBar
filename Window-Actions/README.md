# LaunchBar Window Actions

*[→ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)*

Window actions are applied to the currently active window on your main screen. The action "Move window between screens" is made for two screens.

## Arrange windows

This action arranges 2-4 windows evenly on the screen. 2 windows is the default.

For more options press `space` or `⌘↩`.

The action is looking for windows that belong to the frontmost app first and follows the order of apps in the app switcher after that. Hidden windows/apps will not be included. 

## Disclaimer 

Some windows may not resize properly for varying reasons. It depends on available screen space and required minimum window size. I also experienced some inconsistent weirdness with Safari in my testing. For the most part the actions should run very well though. 

## Other useful information

I know we are all about the keyboard. But I also like my trackpad gestures. So in addition to these I use a cool tool called [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/). 

Also it might be helpful to [learn how windows function](https://macmost.com/a-beginners-guide-to-resizing-mac-windows.html) in general and how to manipulate them with a mouse or trackpad.
