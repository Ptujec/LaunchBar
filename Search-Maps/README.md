# Search Maps Action for LaunchBar

*[â†’ See a list of all my actions here.](https://ptujec.github.io/launchbar)* 

This action improves searching Apple Maps with LaunchBar. The two main features are sugggestions as you type and support for directions. 

## Suggestions

The action shows suggestions as you type. Because, you know, sometimes it is just hard to recall the correct spelling of certain names.

## Directions

If you indicate you are searching for directions (by using "to" or "from"), the action will display how it is interpreting your search query.

If you want to take advantage of the suggestion feature for your destination you can start your query with the destination followed by the word "from". If you do that you will notice that the action will default to the current location if you don't specify a source location. 

## Setup

The suggestion script of this action is written in Swift. Swift scripts offer better performance when compiled. [To compile the script, use the Compile Swift Action](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Compile-Swift-Action#launchbar-action-compile-swift-action).
