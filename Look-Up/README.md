# LaunchBar Action: Look Up in Dictionary

This action is an attempt to recreate some of what [this action](https://github.com/nbjahan/launchbar-livedic) did when it was still working.

Unfortunately, the [official API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/1446842-dcscopytextdefinition) doesn't offer much else than all the info in one long string of text.

I guess it is better than nothing. But in all honesty, it might be easier to just use the [trackpad gesture](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/mac-help/mchl3983326c/mac). There is also a service that is associated with the app by default. It won't give you a preview, but it works fine to enter a query.

If you still want to use this, read on.

## Setup and Note About Swift Scripts

Unfortunately, this is kind of a pain to set up. 

If you don't have Apple's Command Line Tools installed[^1], you will probably be prompted to do so. They will surely be needed if you want to compile the script, which helps run it much faster. 

Unfortunately, I can't share the action with a compiled script. For security reasons, Apple adds a `com.apple.quarantine` attribute to every downloaded file. (You can check that in Terminal with `â€Œxattr` plus the path to the file.) 

Just the added attribute is not necessarily a problem yet. But you will surely run into an issue when the main script file is an executable (the compiled script). If you want to run that, you will get a malware alert.

You can compile the `default.swift` file yourself with `swiftc -O default.swift`. You will need Command Line Tools for that. [But it's a fairly easy and small install](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-command-line-tools-without-xcode/).[^1] Obviously, you also need to change the `LBScriptName` key in `info.plist`, pointing it to the executable. 

Now you have the compiled executable, and you know it matches the source file because you compiled it yourself. But the action still won't run. This is because of the attribute on every other file of the action bundle. You can remove the attribute with LaunchBar's built-in `Open Anyway` action. Just be aware that this will remove the attribute from all files in that bundle. Potentially, there could be other executables that the main script refers to. So check the whole bundle before you do this. And only do it if you trust the source. 

**I know that sounds like a lot. That is why I built [an action to make that process a little easier](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Compile-Swift-Action#readme).**
