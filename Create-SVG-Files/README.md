**Create SVG from Website:** This will pull .svg files and svg code from the current website in Safari and place them at your fingertips. 

**Split SVG into Symbols:** Sometimes there are multiple icons bundled in one file. This action can help split them up in single files.

**Create SVG from Clipboard:** If you copied some svg code and want to turn it into a file this action should help.
