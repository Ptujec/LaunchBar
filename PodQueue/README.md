# LaunchBar Action: Add To PodQueue

My beloved [huffduff-video](https://huffduff-video.snarfed.org) has been shut down. I now use PodQueue to add videos as audio to my podcast client.

The action will try to get the URL from the frontmost app. If that is not successful, it will check your default browser. You can also manually send a URL to the action. 

## Requirements

This action requires an API from [PodQueue.fm](https://podqueue.fm/users/api_key). You will be prompted to enter it the first time you use the action. You can always (re)set it by pressing `option` + `return`.
