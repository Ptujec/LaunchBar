## Function
This action is meant to send text to. If no text is send to the action it will use the most recent clipboard content. 

By default (⏎) the action will try to detect if your selection is in markdown format or not and treat it accordingly. Use modifier keys (see Options) to enforce the respective options. 

The action is associated with MindNode. This means sending text to MindNode will work the same as sending it to the action.

Options:

- ⏎ = Smart mode (default)
- ⌥⏎ = Treat as Markdown
- ⌘⏎ = Make first line main node
- ⇧⏎ = Import as is
