# LaunchBar Action for Phind

[Phind](https://www.phind.com/) is an AI search engine optimized for developers and technical questions. 

This action is designed to be used with "[Instant Send](https://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/InstantSend.html)". Send code to it and you will be provided with a few common prompts to make using Phind even easier.

So, by design, the common entry for this action is code. But if you want to enter a question you can skip the prompts with `command` + `return`. Or, if you forget, you can always use the option at the bottom of the list.
