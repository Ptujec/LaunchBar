# LaunchBar Action: Unicode Function Keys 

As the name reveals this action lists unicode characters of function keys on your keyboard. 

You can either browse the list with `↩`

Or you can search after pressing space `␣`. This will allow you to search for English names even if your UI language is German.

Paste selected character with `↩`, character marked as code with `⌥↩` or the html entity with `⇧↩`. 


**BTW:** There is an action with many more [Unicode characters](https://github.com/snchong/launchbar-unicode) by [@snchong](https://github.com/snchong).
