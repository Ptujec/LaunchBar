# LaunchBar Color Actions

## Color Palette from Website

This action extracts color codes (hex and rgba) from a website and puts them in a local HTML file. You can:

- Copy a color value by clicking on it. 
- Import the whole palette as a list to the system color picker. 
- Browse files (with `space`).
- Choose a browser in which the files should be opened (with `option` + `enter`).

## Import Colors

This action is meant to be used with LaunchBar's "send to" feature. Select a list of color values, e.g., from the clipboard history, hit `tab`, select the action and press `enter`. 

## Note

Unfortunately new lists/palettes will not appear in the color picker of an active application automatically. Either restart the app or click the little `…` icon, choose `open` and select the `.clr` file from `~/Library/Colors`.

If you have an idea how to solve that programmatically let me know. 

## Miscellaneous

- You can find good color palettes on [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). The website action works great here.
- ChatGPT also produces some cool results sometimes. I have a prompt for that in my [Ask ChatGPT action](https://github.com/Ptujec/LaunchBar/tree/master/Ask-ChatGPT#2-use-predefined-prompts). You can select the results in the table and send them to the import action. 
- [System Color Picker by Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/system-color-picker) puts the system color picker in a nice little app, with some helpful additions.
