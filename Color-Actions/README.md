## Color Palette from Website

This action extracts color codes (hex and rgba) from a website and puts them in a local HTML file. You can:

- Copy a color value by clicking on it. 
- Export the whole palette as a list to the system color picker. (Note: You might need to restart an app for new lists to appear in the color picker.)
- Browse files (with `space`).
- Choose a browser in which the files should be opened (with `option` + `enter`).

## Import Colors

This action is meant to be used with LaunchBar's "send to" feature. Select a list of color values, e.g., from the clipboard history, hit `tab`, select the action and press `enter`. 

## Miscellaneous

- [System Color Picker by Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com/system-color-picker) puts the system color picker in a nice little app, with some helpful additions.
