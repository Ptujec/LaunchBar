# LaunchBar Action: MuseScore Files

Missing recent files, when you select MuseScore in LaunchBar and press space? 

This action fixes that. It is associated with MuseScore 3, so it works like it does with most native apps that handle files (e.g. Pages, Keynote, …).

## Settings
If you prefer to show your whole scores folder (sorted by last used) you can set this up in settings  (⇧⏎). 

Note: You need to select the actual action to get to the settings!
