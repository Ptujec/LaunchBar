# LaunchBar Action: MuseScore Files

Missing recent files, when you select MuseScore in LaunchBar and press space? 

This action fixes that. It is associated with MuseScore 3, so it [works like it does with most native apps that handle files](https://youtu.be/lLZgKIthbOk?t=82) (e.g. Pages, Keynote, …). 

## Settings
If you prefer to show your whole scores folder (sorted by last used) you can set this up in settings  (`⇧⏎`). 

Note: You need to select the actual action to get to the settings!
