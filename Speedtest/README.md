This action runs the `networkQuality` command in the background and sends a notification with the results when done.

Alternatively, you can hold <kbd>command</kbd> (<kbd>⌘</kbd>) to run the test in the Terminal app. This way you can follow the progress as the test is running.

The action also displays a **history** of past tests.

These reports are stored in the action’s support path: `~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Action Support/ptujec.LaunchBar.action.Speedtest`.

You can view a report’s details by pressing <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd>, or open the report’s source file by holding <kbd>command</kbd>.

**Note:** Reports are not saved if you run the test in the Terminal app.
